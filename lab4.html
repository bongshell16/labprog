		As the last notes of “thank u, next” rang out over Ariana Grande’s Coachella performance two weekends ago, they helped close one festival and kick off hundreds more. Festival season is really, truly upon us, that sun-soaked season that sees young people from all over the world crisscross America in search of life-changing music and memories.
For such a carefree pastime, the process of planning the perfect festival trip for you and your crew might seem more daunting than expected. One thing that doesn’t have to be difficult is buying tickets. That’s where StubHub comes in. The online ticket marketplace makes experiencing your favorite festivals a snap, whether you’re trying to get into Outside Lands, voting yes for Governors Ball, or skanking all the way to Riot Fest.

Speaking of those festivals: since we spend an inordinate amount of our days thinking about music festivals, we thought we’d make things easy for you, too. Read on for a list of the 2019 festivals that we’re most excited about. We’ve even included ticket links and info on the nearest airports to each ones, just in case the travel bug bites. Pick your festival with us, buy your tickets with StubHub, and take off on an adventure that’s yours and yours alone. If there’s an easier way to have a good time, we haven’t found it yet.
